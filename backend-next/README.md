## Thing learnt

1. Components can be async in Next <br>
2. `Loading.tsx` is reserved to display fillers during async operations <br>
3. `api`/route-name/`route.ts` name is reserved to write backend logic for next.js <br>
4.  Always defer `"client component"` down the tree. <br>
5.  Prisma can be normally integrated. <br>
6. 'SSR Components' can be async and fetch data before being sent to client.<br>
7. 'backend calls' can be directly done with ssr components. No need for axios instead using simple func calls <br>
